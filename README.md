# Computer Graphics


Python libraries used throught assignments:
- PyOpenGL glfw
- numpy
- Pillow
- glm

## Lab2 â€“ OpenGL basics, 2D graphics

Scripts that can:

- draw a triangle with each vertex of a different color,
- draw a rectangle at the given coordinates,
- introduce randomness of colors and deformations in a rectangle,
- draw a fractal - Sierpinski's rectangular carpet,
- draw a fractal - Mandelbrot set.

## Lab3 - Modeling of 3D objects

Script that can:

- build an egg model with the help of points,
- build an egg model with the help of a line,
- build an egg model using triangles,
- build an egg model using triangle strip primitive.

## Lab4 - Interaction with the user, vertex transformations

Script that can:
- rotate the object around the X axis,
- introduce support for a second mouse button (object scaling),
- move the camera around the model,
- improve the movement of the camera around the model:
	- limits in the scope of zooming in / out of the camera,
	- correctness of camera transitions around the model,
	- the ability to switch between object rotation mode and camera movement mode.

## Lab5 - Stage lighting

Script that can:

- generate two light sources around egg model from Lab3,
- enable dynamic change of color components,
- move light sources and their visualization,
- add normal vectors to the egg model,
- display normal vectors and correct them.

## Lab6 - Texturing objects

Script that can:

- draw a textured square,
- draw a textured pyramid,
- load own textures,
- switch loaded textures,
- draw a textured egg from Lab3.

## Lab7 - Graphical stream based on shaders (GLSL)

Scripts that can:

- draw a colored cube,
- draw a colored cube and each side has a different color,
- create multiple copies of an object (on the CPU),
- create multiple copies of an object (instance rendering mechanism),
- deform each object.
